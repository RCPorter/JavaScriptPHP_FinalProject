# JavaScriptPHP_FinalProject
Combined Final Project for PHP and JavaScript Classes

The SQL file for the database used in this project can be found in the "Other" Folder.
The intention of this project was to create something I considered worthy of going in my professional portfolio.
There are no classes in the Sinclair Community College Software Development program that teach the use of
APIs, so the initial focus of this project was to include an API to teach it to myself.
Beyond that, the intention of this project was to do a pretty simple "full stack" project. Rather than make
something for each class, I was able to combine the two classes.
I had one week to complete this project. All of the code in this project was written by me except for what is in the error folder.
I am moving on to more classes and will be focusing on that content. There are many things that I would improve and update
in this project if I were to take the time to do so. But my primary objective at this time is to complete my education.
